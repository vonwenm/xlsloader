# Cassaforte, a Clojure Cassandra Client

Cassaforte is a small, easy to use Clojure client for Apache Cassandra
(recent releases: 2.0, 1.2), part of the [ClojureWerkz
libraries](http://clojurewerkz.org).

For quickstart, please refer to our [Getting Started with Clojure and Cassandra](http://clojurecassandra.info/articles/getting_started.html)
guide.

## Project Goals

 * Provide a Clojure-friendly, easy to use API that reflects Cassandra's data model well. Dealing with the Cassandra Thrift API quirks is counterproductive.
 * Be well maintained.
 * Be well documented.
 * Be well tested.
 * Target modern Cassandra and Clojure releases.
 * Integrate with libraries like Joda Time.
 * Support URI connections to be friendly to Heroku and other PaaS providers.



## Project Maturity

Cassaforte is a relatively young project. It took about a year to
reach `1.0`. It is used heavily in a monitoring and event collection
solution that processes fairly large amount of data.

Cassaforte is based on the now stable new [DataStax Java driver for
Cassandra](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver) and
[Hayt](https://github.com/mpenet/hayt), a fairly battle tested CQL
generation DSL library.



## Dependency Information (Artifacts)

Cassaforte artifacts are [released to Clojars](https://clojars.org/clojurewerkz/cassaforte). If you are using Maven, add the following repository
definition to your `pom.xml`:

## Development

Cassaforte uses [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/TUTORIAL.md). Make
sure you have it installed and then run tests against all supported Clojure versions using

```
lein2 all test
```

Then create a branch and make your changes on it. Once you are done with your changes and all
tests pass, submit a pull request on Github.
